    <h1>Ice Cream - Selena Gomes ft. BLACKPINK</h1>
    <p>
        t's late at night and neither one of us is sleeping
        I can't imagine living my life after you're gone
        Wondering why so many questions have no answers
        I keep on searching for the reason why we went wrong
        Where is our yesterday
        You and I could use it right now
        But if this is goodbye
        Just take my heart when you go
        I don't have the need for it anymore
        I'll always love you, but you're too hard to hold
        Just take my heart when you go
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we are about to take the final step now
        I just can't fool myself, I know there's no turning back
        Face to face it's been an endless conversation
        But when the love is gone you're left with nothing but talk
    </p>
    <p>
        I'd give my everything
        If only I could turn you around
        But if this is goodbye
        Just take my heart when you go
        I don't have the need for it anymore
        I'll always love you, but you're too hard to hold
        Just take my heart when you go
